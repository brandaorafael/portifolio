        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm a developer with experience in several areas, including mobile apps and backend applications. I've just graduated in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic School at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I really like coding and one of my hobbies is to make all sort of projects that I keep available on my Github profile.</p>    

            <p>Besides coding, I really enjoy walking and eating at good restaurants. I'm also passionate about Magic: The Gathering and I'm really into cinema and music.</p>
